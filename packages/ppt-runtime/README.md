# Maintained DSH PPT runtime

Product packages: **`dsh-ppt`** (authoring/export) and **`dsh-ppt-composer`** (PPT button/template chooser). The repository keeps their maintained runtime seeds and generator inputs, while every dev, test, build and package run assembles complete distributions under the ignored `.build/ppt-runtime/packages/` staging root.

This directory maintains the distributed JavaScript extracted at Desktop base `9d4502f`; the complete original TypeScript source was not present. Original copyright notices and factual Kimi Slides research attribution remain in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`. Renaming does not change provenance or establish legal clearance.

## 参考来源

实现方案参考了 **Kimi PPT（Kimi Slides）** 的 PPTD 文档与示例；其中十套模板参考并按 MIT 许可改编自 **Zara Zhang（GitHub：zarazhangrui）** 的 `beautiful-html-templates`。具体参考范围、固定版本和许可证见 [来源说明](core/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md)。

## Catalog and languages

**16 templates, 192 layouts**, each with English (`source/`) and Chinese (`source-zh/`) examples. All 192 gallery/reference previews are rendered from English source. Preview language does not select the user's output language.

- Three retained native packs: Modular Logistics System, Swiss Signal Grid, Nordic Operating Report, expanded from 10 to 12 pages each.
- Engineering Blueprint, Course Workshop, Editorial Notebook: 12 pages each. The first two adapt pinned Apache-2.0 HTML Anything directions; Editorial Notebook is DSH-authored.
- Ten MIT adaptations of Zara Zhang's `beautiful-html-templates@e5e204fb1f3b06290846e7dcd7aceddabeceec8c`: Soft Editorial, Editorial Forest, Signal, Blue Professional, Broadside, Monochrome, Neo-Grid Bold, Sakura Chroma, Playful, Cartesian. All ten now have 12 layouts each, including DSH-authored composition extensions. Office font substitutions are documented per template. This is a selected native adaptation, not a full import of every HTML slide or animation.

Every metadata/design record contains English and Chinese title/body fonts and platform fallbacks. Font names do not distribute or embed fonts. The renderer selects the Latin face for English text and the platform Chinese face for Chinese text, including tables. Chinese serif headings use Songti SC / SimSun / Noto Serif CJK SC; sans uses PingFang SC / Microsoft YaHei / Noto Sans CJK SC. Actual font availability can still affect Office fallback. The preview renderer preserves English word boundaries.

## Build and install

`npm run ppt:build` starts from an empty `.build/ppt-runtime/` directory, regenerates the ten Zara packs, restores the six maintained baseline packs from `scripts/ppt/base-templates/`, applies reviewed English translations, and expands all sixteen packs to twelve layouts each. It validates and renders the 192 English previews, hydrates the runtime clients/catalog, assembles both package directories, then atomically projects those directories into `node_modules` for local execution. It never writes generated templates, previews, archives or hash manifests back into tracked source paths. Every pack retains explicit English/Chinese font pairs. The two original experiments live in `scripts/ppt/rich-layouts.mjs`; the other composition plans and editable geometry live in `scripts/ppt/composition-library.mjs`.

The step is skipped when nothing it reads has changed: `scripts/ppt-build-cache.mjs` fingerprints `packages/ppt-runtime/`, `scripts/ppt/`, the pipeline scripts and `package-lock.json`, and records the result in `.build/ppt-runtime/build-inputs.json`. When only `node_modules` was reinstalled, the staged packages are projected again without regenerating them. Set `DSH_PPT_FORCE_BUILD=1` to force a full rebuild.

`npm ci` bootstraps from the tracked local package seeds, so a clean checkout does not need a pre-existing archive. The `dev`, `build` and `test` lifecycles all invoke the same preparation step; every package script delegates to `build`. Electron Builder excludes the bootstrap links and copies the current staged packages explicitly. Tests verify the generated distributions, language coverage, fonts, activation and state migration. The 23 withdrawn designs and 345 excluded images remain absent; `excluded-assets.json` is a hash-only regression list.

## Compatibility

For Harness `0.1.7-rc.1`, the chooser uses `conversation.hero.dock` (list, session-maybe, InputZone owner) before a session exists and the existing session-only `conversation.composer.dock` afterwards. The hero outlet belongs to ConversationContent and sits after its input bar; it must not be rendered inside the independently registered InputBar. Only one chooser outlet is active at a time, sharing the mode-button store. The panel measures the composer card width because the upstream session dock can shrink to its content width. The conversation patch can drop the extra hero outlet when Harness provides an equivalent public pre-session outlet.

The built-in profile loads one `dsh-ppt-composer` plugin. The Skill, new automatic context records, client registration and primary RPC use DSH names. Historical attribution is kept in notices and an entry-point comment.

Desktop's startup bundle reconciliation removes `dsh-ppt` and `dsh-ppt-composer` from the normal Profile's extra bundle list: the Desktop patch already loads the composer, which mounts the core. This prevents duplicate preview routes and the `dsh-ppt-bundled` skill provider when a Profile also declares these packages. Dependencies, installed packages, user patch files and existing `kimi-ppt` projects are retained. Custom patch rows are not rewritten; this reconciliation handles standard bundle declarations only. Standalone Harness profiles do not opt into Desktop's bundle ownership.

The legacy on-disk `kimi-ppt` directory is deliberately retained to preserve sessions, revisions and output files. `/kimi-ppt` remains an alias for in-flight older clients; legacy Skill-root config/env values and old automatic snapshots are handled explicitly. The three retained template IDs migrate to DSH IDs without losing selection; removed IDs fall back visibly. User-authored messages and historical generated decks are preserved.

PPT remains preinstalled. Its automatic instructions are scoped to sessions where the user enabled the PPT button.

Ordinary conversations use the upstream `office-pptx` skill for general authoring and edits. While PPT mode is active, the skill registry resolves the current session's invocation policy on every catalog and body read, keeping `office-pptx` unavailable to automatic model calls while leaving Word/Excel and explicit user invocation available. The template route retains its PPTD tools and selected template; validation/export failures do not trigger a switch to python-pptx. Disabling PPT mode restores the general skill, including after cached reads. The host catalog carries the durable session ID before Agent activation, and the policy listener is removed with this plugin.

### Personal PPT templates

The chooser's **My templates** tab accepts PPTX files with the configured slide limit (40 by default). Uploads use the Host's shared transport and archive resource limits. They produce page previews and conversion diagnostics. **Save template** registers the reviewed file in the current Desktop profile; new sessions and restarts read the same library. Identical source bytes resolve to the saved template. Users can rename or remove entries; generated task projects stay available.

The host stores source PPTX, editable PPTD pages, assets, previews and conversion records under `personal-templates/` inside the configured PPT data root. Drafts belong to their initiating session. Registered templates belong to this local Desktop profile, including remote connections to that profile. Account-based sharing and cross-device synchronization require a separate identity integration.

`ppt_template_create_project` copies the selected personal template into a new confined workspace directory. The model then adapts that copy with the existing PPTD tools and exports through `pptd_render`. The saved source remains separate from generated task files. All conversion and copy operations use the existing bounded parser/compiler and host audit. Company template fidelity requires review of actual imported pages, particularly master elements and advanced Office objects. Product rules and evidence: [Personal PPT templates](../../docs/ppt-personal-templates.md).

Generated templates, previews, package directories and build diagnostics live under ignored `.build/ppt-runtime/`. Validation evidence and temporary exports live under ignored `doc/ppt-remediation/`. Windows packaging and native Windows PowerPoint require their own runner/device validation.

### Layout refinement

The content layouts now include evidence panels, reconciled contributions, direct chart annotations, exception rows and accountable roadmaps. Shared authoring guidance lives in `scripts/ppt/refinement-guidance.mjs` and the bundled `references/composition.md`. English and Chinese pages retain separate line wrapping and font fallbacks.

Historical withdrawn Kimi-associated reference images were inspected locally to identify general information-design principles. This iteration does not restore those images, their guides, or source files to the distributed packs. The new compositions and wording are authored in the maintained generators; current palette/font provenance remains unchanged.

### Shared preview assets

The build keeps the 192 reference JPGs only in the core skill directory. Both browser clients receive a small manifest of `/dsh-ppt/previews/<sha256>.jpg` URLs instead of Base64 image copies. The core optionally registers an HTTP route using the existing host web server, serving only build-listed reference images with immutable caching. No user files or configurable skill directories are exposed. Model reference reads, bilingual sources and editable exports continue using the existing core files; no remote download is required. Rebuilds change image URLs when the bytes change.

### Validation feedback

`pptd_check` is read-only and returns every diagnostic, including file, page and element ID. `pptd_render` returns `status: needs_revision` with the full `check` when blocked by validation, without publishing or consuming delivery capacity; only `status: exported` includes delivery metadata. Warning-only checks remain exportable. Filesystem, authorization and runtime faults still fail normally. Existing sessions refresh their automatic authoring instructions to this workflow.

The CLI resolves npm `.bin` symlinks before detecting its entry point. `check --json` retains its complete checker output and conventional nonzero exit code for failed validation; blocked `render --json` also prints complete diagnostics and `exported: false`. Neither bypasses the compiler checks.

Authoring diagnostics group misplaced text-style fields by page while retaining per-field issues. Layout estimates wait until an element has a valid field structure. Tool diagnostics include confined absolute paths and `pptd_read_file` arguments. New files accept an omitted or empty `expected_sha256`; replacements still require the current hash. The bundled CLI and tool compiler apply the same structural checks.

### Text escape semantics

Multiline text uses actual line breaks, with YAML `|-` as the shared authoring form. The CLI and host use `lib/text-escapes.js` to report `text-escaped-newline` for literal `\n` or `\r` in text elements and table cells before export. An explicit boolean `literalEscapes: true` preserves intentionally displayed code, escape notation or paths; imported PPTX text carries this declaration when the original already displays those characters. The declaration leaves layout checks active. V4 automatic Skill snapshots explain the correction loop and replace older V2/V3 snapshots in active PPT sessions.
