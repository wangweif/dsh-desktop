 * The single fail-closed owner of startup Profile mutations.

 * A recovery-required journal short-circuits every mutator. A deferred
 * migration keeps the legacy installation without projection,
 * prune, or repair after the failure. Startup leaves destructive package
 * repair to the explicit recovery flow, with one declaration-only exception:
 * when the boot preflight fails, third-party bundles that are declared but no
 * longer installed have their declaration dropped once and the check retried,
 * because the Safe Mode plugin controls cannot clear that fault themselves.
 * No package files, user patch rows or plugin data are removed.
 * Bundle reconciliation still runs: missing installed layers are added and
 * duplicate PPT layers owned by Desktop are removed from the
 * manifest only. Package files, user patches and plugin data remain intact.
 * The market's verified baseline is the targeted exception: dshmarket is a
 * core bundle, never a generation, and the app cannot boot without a working
 * one — so it is demoted out of any generation and brought to the baseline in
 * the shared tree ahead of projection and ahead of the removal-verification
 * gate, while Harness is stopped. A baseline that cannot be installed only
 * blocks startup when the market already present is unusable.
